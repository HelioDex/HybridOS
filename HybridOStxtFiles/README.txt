FAQ

  Why should I use HybridOS?

   - HybridOS is good for its compatibility, compactivity and easiness of installation.
  
   - HybridOS loads faster and is more modifiable than most operating systems, even on 
	   potato processors. (Athlon II x4, looking at you...) 
  
  Can I sell this?

   - You physically can, but please don't, because it's not allowed.
	   You can give it away for free, though.
	 - It's perfectly fine to sell your own modified HybridOS distrobution and put your own
	   restrictions on it ONLY if you have a Distro License* (Otherwise we can take legal action!), but 
		 please credit the original HybridOS makers.
	 - If you have bought any of the official HybridOS distros, you have been scammed. Phone the customer 
	   support you bought it from and ask for a refund. Call Venimuex/ZoNeTech Customer support as well and
		 we will take legal action (maybe).

We are not responsible if you modify this OS and it doesn't work anymore.
If this happens, download a new copy for free.

HybridOS can work on all operating systems that can be compatible with 
python 3 .py (or have python 3.6 or later installed) and text files.

How to run HybridOS :-

	Method 1: Open the .py file and run it in your shell or from your python
	IDE, or the one that was installed with the executable version of HybridOS (that isn't out yet).

	Method 2: If you have an internet connection, go to HybridOS.Heliodex.repl.run.

* Get a distro License by asking for one at crowntek.boards.net, or emailing kellylewin2016@gmail.com.
  Then maybe we'll give you one.
